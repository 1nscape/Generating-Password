# Generating a Random Password

## Description

In this week's assignment, we had to create a random password generator that asks user for input by answering series of prompts that provide the criteria for the password. Once user selects all the criteria that is wanted (at least one criteria must be chosen, otherwise the code will return) the code generates a random password depending on length chosen by user (length range is between 8 to 128 characters). 

## What was done?

All of the code is written in JavaScript as the HTML and CSS template was provided and no changes were required in either of the two languages. Many variables and arrays had to be created in order to criteria a range of choices for each criteria. Conditional statements had to be used in order for criterias to be applied, and a loop used as well. Two empty arryas were also created in order to combine two arrays and ultimately push into another which provided with the final randomized password.
